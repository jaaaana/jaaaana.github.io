            Hello! I am Jana Hristova, student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering of the Ss.
            Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje. I completed my primary school education at OU „Kocho Racin“, while I graduated
            high school as an IB diploma recipient from NOVA International Schools.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my high school education, I participated in different school clubs and projects. During my freshman
            year, I was a member of the school Robotics club which allowed me to participate in the First Tech Challenge
            competition held in Bucharest, Romania. In addition to this, during my junior year, I was co-president of my
            high school’s Student Council, a position which led me to organizing a variety of events such as movie
            screenings, club fairs etc. Between my junior and senior year of high school, I did an internship focused on
            front-end web development which allowed me to experience working in a professional environment, as well as
            develop my web design skills. Lastly, in my senior year, I was a member of a group that organized a charity
            concert which aimed to collect funds for helping families in need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beside my education and other related activities, I also dedicate a significant amount of time to my
            hobbies, such as reading, travelling and photography. In fact, it is these hobbies that inspired me to make
            this website which focuses on my travels and the photographs that came from them. Photography has been a
            hobby of mine since my first year of high school when I took a photography class which not only sparked my
            love for the art form, but taught me how to work with both film and digital cameras. As a result, the photos
            that I have collected for this website are both film and digital, offering a variety of colors,
            perspectives, and sentiments that I hope the visitors of this website will enjoy!
