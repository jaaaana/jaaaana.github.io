                <h2>Prague, Czech Republic (April, 2019)</h2>
                Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, captivated me with its rich history and
                architecture. From the iconic Prague Castle to the charming streets of the Old Town, every corner
                revealed a new adventure. I especially liked the Astronomical Clock, a picture of which you can find in
                the Photo Journal section of this website. Exploring the picturesque neighborhoods and immersing
                myself in the city's vibrant cultural scene made for an unforgettable visit. Prague's timeless beauty
                and welcoming atmosphere left a lasting impression.

                <h2>Sicily, Italy (July, 2019)</h2>
                Sicily, the captivating island off Italy's coast, offered a great experience. The beauty of Mount Etna,
                Europe's largest active volcano, left me in awe. Exploring the vibrant streets of Palermo, the island's
                capital, revealed a rich tapestry of history, culture, and flavors. From its bustling markets filled
                with spices to its beautiful architectural landmarks like the Palermo Cathedral, the city exuded a
                unique charm. Sicily's natural beauty, including its pristine beaches and the rugged landscapes
                surrounding Mount Etna, combined with Palermo's vibrant atmosphere to create an unforgettable journey.

                <h2>Cologne, Germany (June, 2022)</h2>
                I visited Cologne last summer with a couple of friends and I had a wonderful time. The city has
                beautiful architecture that is the perfect blend of old and new. Of course, the building that stuck out
                the most was the Cologne Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage site which is a true epitome of the city’s
                history and architectural magnificence. Apart from the city’s neighborhoods and architecture, I also
                particularly enjoyed the Ludwig Museum, a modern art museum which holds works from artists such as Andy
                Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and others. In Cologne, I also attended a Lorde concert which was an experience
                of a lifetime in and of itself. She is an artist that defined my teenage years and I couldn’t believe
                that I heard her live. The venue of the concert was beautiful and Cologne was an amazing setting for the
                concert.

                <h2>Venice, Italy (September, 2022)</h2>
                The primary purpose of my visit to Venice was the Biennale of Arts and I have to say that Venice and the
                Biennale were the most captivating combination. The city's timeless beauty provided the perfect backdrop
                for the extraordinary art showcased at the Biennale. From the Giardini pavilions to the enchanting boat
                rides through the canals, Venice proved to be a most magical experience. The Arsenale's immersive
                exhibitions were also unforgettable, pushing the boundaries of perception and leaving a lasting
                impression on the observer. Apart from this, I was also fascinated by Venice’s architecture and its
                labyrinth-like streets, some of which were so narrow that you could spread your arms and touch the
                facades of houses on opposing sides of the street. All in all, I could say that despite being very
                beautiful, Venice is also a very inspiring and calming city.

                <h2>Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (May, 2023)</h2>
                This May, I travelled to Amsterdam and Rotterdam to visit some friends who study there and I had a
                wonderful experience. Amsterdam, with all of its canals and beautiful neighborhoods with narrow houses,
                was one of the most picturesque cities I have visited. While there, I visited the Stedelijk museum, as
                well as many beautiful parks, markets and cafes. Rotterdam was also a wonderful city to visit, offering
                more modern architecture with different innovative skyscrapers and buildings. There I visited the
                legendary Markthal with its unforgettable ceiling artwork which showcases different fruits, flowers,
                insects etc. In addition, I also visited the yellow cube houses which embody the inventive spirit of the
                city. All in all, both of these cities left an amazing impression on me and I would highly recommend
                them as a travel destination.
